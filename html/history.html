            <h1>Our History</h1>

            <p> Netflix, Inc. is an American streaming platform and entertainment company. Located in Los Gatos
                (California), the company was founded on <strong> August 29, 1997 </strong>and a year later it began its
                activity, offering a DVD rental service through the postal mail. Currently, Netflix participates in the
                production of audiovisual works , from the creation or acquisition of the product to its worldwide
                diffusion. <br><br>

                In <strong>2000</strong>, even with DVD rental as the only service, Netflix introduced a personalized
                recommendation system, based on the rating of one to five stars that its customers made of the materials
                they rented through its Internet site. The continuous improvement of this system —which in
                <strong>2017</strong> would be changed to a “thumbs up/down” system—, as well as the use of other data
                that the platform obtains from its clients known as data mining, is considered the main cause of the
                company success.

                In <strong>2007</strong>, Netflix starts its video-on-demand service in the United States, exclusively
                to be used through personal computers; Starting in <strong>2008</strong>, different options were added
                to access the catalog by streaming: video game consoles, smart TVs, tablets, etc. On February 25, 2007,
                its billionth DVD entered. In 2009 its physical catalog offers 100,000 titles and its clientele exceeds
                10 million subscribers.

                In 2011, the company began operations for the first time outside the United States and Canada, offering
                its catalog by streaming in the Latin American and Caribbean region. In 2012 it offers its services in
                some European countries, and as of 2016 it offers its contents to the whole world with the exception of
                the Crimea region, and the territories of North Korea, Mainland China, Iran, Iraq and Syria.

                customers worldwide, most of them outside of USA. Although the estimates made by Wall Street for that
                period were 7.6 million new customers, the quarantine implemented in different countries around the
                world due to the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to the fact that the real number was more than double
                (15.8 million);13 during the first months of 2022, for the first time since 2011, the platform reports a
                loss of 200,000 customers and projects 2 million fewer for the second quarter of the year. <br><br>
